                <span class="text-bold">Git</span> is a powerful, distributed version control system designed to efficiently manage source code for various projects. Imagine Git as a library where all versions of your work are stored. Instead of having a single copy of a book (version of code), you have an entire shelf with different editions, each with its own date and change description. This allows you to revert to any point in your project's history, compare different versions, and even work on multiple ideas simultaneously without risking data loss.

                A <span class="text-bold">version control system (VCS)</span> is a tool used to track changes in files, most commonly in software development projects. There are three main types of version control:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Local:</span> All changes are stored on the local computer. This is the simplest but least secure method.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Centralized:</span> There is a single central server where all file versions are stored. Each user has access to the same copy.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Distributed:</span> Each user has a full copy of the repository on their computer. This allows for offline work and easier collaboration within teams. Git is such a system.</li>
            </ul>

            <article>
            <ul>
                <li><p><span class="text-bold">Linux:</span></p>
                <code>sudo apt install git # Debian</code>
                <p>or</p>
                <code>dnf install git # Fedora</code></li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Windows:</span> Download the installer from the official Git website and follow the instructions.</li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="text-bold">macOS:</span> You can install Git using Homebrew:</p>
                    <code>brew install git</code>
                    <p>Or download the installer from the official website.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Repository">
            <header>Repository</header>
            <article>
                <p>A <span class="text-bold">repository</span> is where all project information is stored, including files, change history, and configuration. To create a new, local repository, navigate to the desired directory in your terminal and execute the command:</p>
                <code>git init</code>
                <p>or</p>
                <code>git init &lt;repository name&gt;</code>
                <p>This is like creating a new, empty shelf in our library.</p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Commit">
            <header>Commit</header>
            <article>
                <p>A <span class="text-bold">commit</span> is a snapshot of the changes in the repository. It's like adding a new book to the shelf. To add all new or modified files to the staging area, run:</p>
                <code>git add *</code>
                <p>Then save these changes to the repository:</p>
                <code>git commit -m "First commit"</code>
                <p>Where <span class="code">-m</span> is used to add a brief description of the changes.</p>
            </article>

                <p>
                    A <span class="text-bold">branch</span> is an independent line of development for a project. Think of it as a new shelf in the library where you're working on a new version of a book. To create a new branch, execute:
                </p>
                <code>
                    git branch &lt;branch name&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    To switch to a different branch:
                </p>
                <code>
                    git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;
                </code>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Merge">
            <header>Merge</header>
            <article>
                <p>A <span class="text-bold">merge</span> is the combination of two branches. It's like merging two books into one. To merge the <span class="code">new-branch</span> into the main branch (<span class="code">main</span>), first switch to the main branch:</p>
                <code>git checkout main</code>
                <p>Then perform the merge:</p>
                <code>git merge new-branch</code>
                <p>If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually.</p>
