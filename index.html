                <span class="text-bold">Git</span> is a powerful, distributed version control system that enables tracking changes in source code and collaboration on projects. With Git, you can restore previous versions of files, compare changes, and efficiently work in teams by merging different code variations. Git is extremely popular in the programming community but can also be used to manage various types of files.

            <p>
                A <span class="text-bold">version control system</span> is a tool used to manage changes in files. It allows you to track the history of changes, restore previous versions, compare different variations, and collaborate on projects in teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three main methods of version control:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Local:</span> The entire history of changes is stored on the user's local computer.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Centralized:</span> There is one central server where the main copy of the project is stored. Users download working copies and send their changes to the server.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Distributed:</span> Each user has a full copy of the repository, allowing for offline work and independence of individual copies. Git is an example of a distributed system.</li>
            </ul>
